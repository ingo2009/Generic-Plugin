# Generic-Plugin
A plugin that helps developers create more easily Typesetter CMS plugins 

This is the initial upload.  
A guy on twitter recommended to go public with the first development version (even when it's only the hello world greetinx).  
If I remember who he was I will mention him here.

SO, here it is.  
Watch out for new functionality.

Have funâ€¦

P.S. : A license will probably not necessary since this will only run inside Typesetter CMS and they have a license.
